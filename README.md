# CRUD Vue 3, Vue Router, Vite, Axios, Node front end

## Description

This is a single page application front end intended to consume REST APIs. It is modelled on a personal media library where the user can add, update, delete and search through their personal media titles. Vue 3 provides the reactive web interface, vue-router is used to handle component navigation within the SPA, Axios is used to send and receive the HTTP requests and vite is used for building and testing.

This was designed with the NodeJS, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB server backend [link]. This is half of my MEVN Library project.
