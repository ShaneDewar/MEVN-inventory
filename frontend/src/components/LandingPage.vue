  <h1>
    MEVN Library
  </h1>
  This project is an example project representing a personal library. So you can add your media, search through your library, update and remove titles as well as track if you've read or listened to the media and add whatever notes you may like.
  The library is a Vue 3 SPA that uses Vue + Vue Router + Vite + Axios for the front end, an Express + Node + Mongoose server, and Mongodb for the database.
